# Contributing

We love contribution from everyone!

When contributing to this repo, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or discussion with the maintainers of this repository before making a change.

## Issue

All bug reports and feature requests happen through Issues. If you have any bugs for feature requests(no matter if you are a maintainer), please create a issue frist. Github Discussions is for questions and anything else.

We leverage labels to categorize issues, so it's the repo maintainer's responsibility to add suitable label(s) for every issues.

## Pull Request

Pull Requests should follow the single responsibility principle and small Pull Requests are encouraged. Try not to include some additional stuff into the pull request. For example, do not fix any typos other than your current context or do not add a tiny bug fix to a feature.

All code changes happen through Pull Requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. If you are a member of Alpensegler, clone the repo and create your branch from `master`. Or, fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've added code that need documentation, update the documentation.
4. Follow the template to issue a pull request.
5. Follow [conventional commit spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to write the pull request title.

Labels are optional but encouraged for Pull Requests.
